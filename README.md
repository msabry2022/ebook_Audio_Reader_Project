# ebook_Audio_Reader_Project
voice reader from a txt file (separate file)


## Project Story
**in october 2022 i finished CS50 course based on python.**
**in the end of the course the final project was read text with voice from inside the code.**
**i see that this program is not a practical program for users don't know how to use python.**
**i start using the basics of python i learned in the course to make the progrm read from TXT file.**
**after i starting edit the code to do that i find that the voice speed is very quick.**
**i searched for the documentation of "pyttsx3" to modify the speed of the voice.**
**and change the default voice**

### i hope you see it a good starting point for me in the first project in my life
